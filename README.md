Do you know what song is going to play as you walk down the aisle?<br>
Let guests at your wedding vote for the song! The wedding DJ will have access to voting results and will play the winning song.

#### Try it here: https://song-vote-react.vercel.app/

#### This app includes:

- Main page, with concise explanation of the process
- Form page, for the actual voting
- Thanks page, generates after voting is completed
- DJ page, accessed through a secret URL (regular users can't view the results)
- JS script that prohibits a user from voting more than once

## Mobile-first approach

This web app is best used on a smartphone, but is fully responsive and can be viewed in other devices as well.

## Built with specific occasion in mind

This app was developed to be used in an event such as a wedding, therefore it was designed with simplicity and usability in mind. Younger users will have an inherit understanding of the voting process without much attention, and older users will be directed by clear and precise instructions.
